# Uestc_QPZD-Model-Source-Code
The QPZD model is a physics-based compact model suitable for compound semiconductor transistors such as GaAs and GaN. The modeling principle of this model involves dividing the transistor channel into multiple characteristic regions and integrating classical semiconductor device physics theories, such as the electric field-electron velocity relationship and the gradual channel approximation, to obtain the constitutive model equations in the intrinsic region. Based on this, key physical parameters are utilized to further consider higher-order dispersion effects, including self-heating and trapping. The QPZD model accurately characterizes the device's nonlinear fundamental/harmonic behavior, intermodulation, noise, and other metrics.
